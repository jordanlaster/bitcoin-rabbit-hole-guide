## **What is Bitcoin?**

📌 
[Read The Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://www.buddylasta.com/pdfs/bitcoin.pdf) written by bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Then check out the Bitcoin Fundamentals page below. After reading through the fundamentals, I recommend building on them with the resources in the “Getting Started” section.

<br />

<br />

## Getting Started

📌 Just getting started with bitcoin? Work through the to-dos below to gain an understanding of what it is, how it works, and what it solves.

<br />

## **Proof of Work**

📌 Bitcoin-related articles, books, podcasts, videos, and additional resources have been curated for you below. Mark a resource as “Done” as proof of the work you've put in to understand bitcoin. Always do your own research. Don't trust everything you read or hear, verify.

<br />

<br />

## **Buy & Earn**

📌 You can purchase bitcoin from exchanges that require your personal information (KYC) or exchanges that do not (noKYC). To understand the tradeoffs click [here](https://bitcoiner.guide/nokyconly/). I highly recommend noKYC. You can also earn bitcoin through work and everyday purchases.

<br />

## Self-Custody

📌 Once you've purchased bitcoin, it's not rightfully yours until you've taken custody of it. How do you do that? You need to download a bitcoin wallet. Below are recommended mobile, hardware (HWW), and desktop wallet options for on-chain and [Lightning](https://lightning.network/). There are also companies listed below that help you store your bitcoin via [multisig](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multi-signature) (for retirement as well). Check em out!

<br />

## Wallet Backups

📌 A backup is a complete set of information from which your bitcoin can be recovered. If you lose access to your wallet and you have no backup, your bitcoin may be gone forever. This is why you need backups! Read the backup guide below to get started.

<br />

<br />

## Privacy

> “**Privacy** isn’t about something to hide. **Privacy** is about something to protect.” — Edward Snowden.
> 

📌 Read the privacy resources below to learn how to gain privacy on a bitcoin standard.

<br />

<br />

## Nodes

📌 A node keeps a historic record of all bitcoin transactions, it validates transactions, and it dictates and enforces the rules of the network. Think of it as your own copy of the bitcoin network that allows you to verify bitcoin is operating as it should be. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D11R0W2uxeM&t=133s) to learn the benefits of running one. You can buy a raspberry pi 4 and flash a particular node's OS on it or you can buy a plug-and-play version. Check out all the options below.

<br />

*Note: I have built or tried almost every node in the list above. Reach out if you need help!*

<br />

## Mining

📌 Bitcoin miners mine bitcoin, secure the network, and confirm transactions on the network. Read this [article](https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-nodes-vs-miners-demystified) for a more in-depth explanation. Check out the information below if you want to buy a miner and start mining!
